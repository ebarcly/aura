## Project Milestones

### Milestone 0: Project Setup & Scaffolding - âœ… COMPLETE

- **Objective:** Initialize the Next.js project, set up the GitHub repository, create the Supabase project, and establish a confirmed connection between the app and the database.
- **Status:** Completed. The `feat/supabase-integration` branch has been merged into `main`.

### Milestone 1: Authentication & User Dashboard

  - A callback route to handle the authentication response from GitHub.
